## Annoucement
* Readings for week 5 are released. 

## Plan for coding exercises
* Exercise 1 (PCA): released on Mar 29; due on April 18
* Exercise 2 (FA/CA): released on April 12, due on April 18 (for FA) and/or 25 (for CA)
* Exercise 3 (Text analysis): to be released on April 17, due on May 2 
  + If you have taken MACS 60000, next week's content will be a bit repetitive. We can discuss about alternatives. 

# Recap

## Factor analysis 
* assumes that the data is generated from a few hidden dimensions and seeks to recover the dimensions
* Mathematical formulation:
 $$
 x_1 = \lambda_{11}f_1 + \lambda_{12}f_2 + ... + \lambda_{1m}f_m + e_1 \\
 x_2 = \lambda_{21}f_2 + \lambda_{22}f_2 + ... + \lambda_{2m}f_m + e_2 \\
 \vdots\\
 x_p = \lambda_{p1}f_2 + \lambda_{p2}f_2 + ... + \lambda_{pm}f_m + e_2 \\
 m < p
 $$

 * The error terms are idiosyncratic and are uncorrelated among themselves and with any factor.
 * The factors can be uncorrelated or correlated. 
 
## Factor analysis via PCA approximation 
 1. Apply PCA to the dataset 
 2. Keep the first $m$ principal components scaled by the square roots of the eigenvalues and treat the rests as idiosyncratic. 
 3. Rotate the PC factors according to some criterion. 
 
## Orthogoal rotation

## Correspondence analysis
* Goal: given a count table $\mathbf{X} = [x_{ij}]$, to find row-weight and column-weight vectors $\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^p$, such that

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
r_i &\propto \sum_{j=1}^p\ c_j \frac{x_{ij}}{x_{i\cdot}}, \\
\text{and } c_j &\propto \sum_{i=1}^n\ r_i \frac{x_{ij}}{x_{\cdot j}}, 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $x_{i\cdot}$ and $x_{\cdot j}$ are the sums of the $i$th row and the $j$th column, respectively.

## Basic Intuition
* The rows and columns are mutually defined in the same space.
  + A row is represented by its weight on all the columns. (A person's cultural taste is defined by the genres he/she likes.)
  + A column is represented by the contribution of all the rows. (The taste of a genre is represented by the people who like it.)
  + All positions are estimated at once through matrix decomposition. 

## Multiple correspondence analysis
* is an extension of CA that applies to multiple categorical variables. 
* MCA starts with turning individual-level data into an indicator matrix:

## Indicator matrix

|  | ... | Student | ... | Engineer| ... | Comedy | ... | Sci-fi| 
|---------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Individual 1      | ... |  1 |  ...   | 0 | ... | 1 | ... | 0 |
| ...     | ...  |   ... |  ...   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 
| Individual $n$      | ...    | 0 | ...   | 1 | ... | 0 | ... | 1 | 

# Coding in Class

# Break

# Let's talk about measurement. 

## Discussion
* What is the distinction between "deliberative" and "non-deliberative" cognition? 
* What types of measurement better capture each type of cognition? 

## We will discuss more about using texts as a method next time. 

## Goldberg & Stein (2018)

* How could global cultural patterns emerge without close interaction?
* Where does dimensional come from?
