        	<p>Repeated observations of social events over long periods of time are difficult to collect. But with emergence of new types of data, the task has become increasingly possible and is presenting huge opportunities for sociologists to test social theories that have long been speculated without rigorous examination. My research interest is in developing and applying innovative methods to analyze digitized archival data and answer questions about macro-historical social change.</p>
        	<p>I have spent years analyzing job transfers of political elites in the communist party China. It is a project that I built up from scratch by using machines to code party elites' CVs. My goal is to understand how the party state has evolved through division of labor and circulation of its elite members. I am also currently involved in a computational content analysis project tracking ideological changes in the full text of 60 years of the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the communist party. The aim of that project is to understand how incompatible ideas in an ideological system can be gradually reconciled and how the concept of "market" was unfettered in that process.</p>
